1. 	a)	A procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to be executed and the order in which the actions should be executed is called an algorithm.
	b)	Specifying the execution order of statements by the computer is called program control.
	c) 	All programs can be written in terms of three types of control statements: sequence structure, selection structure, iteration structure.
	d)	The if...else selection statement is used to execute one action when a condition is true and another action when that condition is false.
	e)	Several statements grouped together in braces({ and }) are called a block/compound statement.
	f)	The while iteration statement specifies that a statement or group of statements is to be executed repeatedly while some condition remains true.
	g)	Iteration of a set of instructions a specific number of times is called a definite/counter-controlled itteration.
	h)	When it's not known in advance how many times a set of statements will be repeated, a sentinal value can be used to terminate the iteration.
