	1.
		a.  Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called programs.
		b.	The key logical units of the computer are the input unit, output unit, memory unit, ALU, CPU, and secondary storage.
		c.	The three types of languages discussed in this chapter are machine languages, assembly languages, and high-level languages.
		d.	The programs that translate high-level-languages programs into machine language are called compilers.
		e.	Android is an operating system for mobile devices based on the Linux kernel and Java.
		f.	Release candidate software is generally feature complete, (supposedly) bug free and ready for use by the community.
		g.	The Wii remote, as well as many smartphones, use a(n) accelerometer which allows the device to respond to motion.
		h.	C is widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.
		i.	Swift is the new programming language for developing iOS and Mac apps.
	2.
		a. C programs are normally typed into a computer using a(n) editor program.
		b. In a C system, a(n) preprocessor program automatically executes before the translation phase begins.
		c. The two most common kinds preprossor directives are including other files in the file to be compiled and performing various text replacements.
		d. The linker program combines the output of the compiler with various library functions to produce an executable image.
		e. The loader program transfers the executable image from disk to memory.
	3.
		a. Objects have the property of information hiding -- although objects may know how to communicate with one another across well-defined interfaces, they normally are not allowed to know how other objects are implemented.
		b. In object-oriented programming languages, we create classes to house the set of methods that perform tasks.
		c. With inheritance, new classes of objects are derived by absorbing characteristics of existing classes, then adding unique characteristics of their own.
		d. The size, shape, color and weight of an object are considered attributes of the object's class.
	4. Categorize each of the following as hardware of software:
		a. a microprocessor - hardware
		b. RAM - hardware
		c. Microsoft Visual Studio - software
		d. a preprocessor - software
		e. a scanner - hardware
		f. an internet browser - software
	5. Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
		a. Translator programs called compilers convert programs written in high-level languages into machine language.
		b. A multi-core processor impliments multiple processors on a single integrated-circuit chip.
		c. A loader places a program in memory so that it can be executed.
		d. Programs in machine language generally consist of strings of numbers that instruct computers to perform their most elementary operations one at a time.
		e. A bit is the smallest data item in a computer.
		f. Fields are composed of characters or bytes.
		g. A file is a collection of data organized for easy access and manipulation.
		h. C programs typically go through six phases to be executed. These are edit, preprocess, compile, link, load and execute
		i. Preprocessing usually allows including other files and various text replacements.
		j. Objects and classes are essentially reusable software components.
	6. Fill in the blanks
		a. Cloud computing allows software, platforms and infrastructure to be hosted on demand over the internet.
		b. Ajax , a Web 2.0 technology, helps Internet-based applications perform like desk-top applications.
		c. Android, based on the Linux kernel and Java, is the fastest growing mobile and smartphone operating system.
	7. Discuss the meaning of each of the following
		a. linking - inserting code for missing functions found elsewhere.
		b. loading - writing the program to the system memory to be executed.
		c. execution - performing the actions of the program one instruction at a time.
	8. What are the standard input, output, and error streams?
			The keyboard, computer stream, and computer screen.
	10. Describe a watch as an object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance. Consider alarm clock, messages, encapsulation and information hiding.
			As an object, my acme chromograph watch would be an instance of the time keeping class. Unlike the alarm clock, it does not have the behavior
			off producing sound at a certain time. It inherits the attribute of seconds, minutes, and hours, and has the unique attribute of a spungebob face.
		 	I know it contains a method that starts the chromograph when it recieves the button message, but i don't know how this method works because
	 		the information is hidden by the backplate.
