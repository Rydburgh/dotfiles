# Trying to use inkscape-shortcut-manager by Gilles Castel to manage keychords and templates
* Deleted and reinstalled scripts to force update to inkscape compatability
* Cloned repository into home and started troubleshooting
* Trying to get zsh to recognize path .local/bin/inkscape-shortcut-manager
* System froze when running main.py from dmenu
* Session doesn't freeze when executable is removed from main.py, so i am removing executable from all .py
* Seems like it's working, but i'm giving up on inkscape-figures, doesn't seem to want to save properly
* Testing the single key commands
* Crashing out
