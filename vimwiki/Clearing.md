# You have to Want god like a drowning man wants air.

Close your eyes, sit back, and relax.

Start breathing in through the nose and thinking of a beautiful collored
energy light, whatever color you want, or possitive thoughts and happiness
and when you breath out, breath out any fears, worries, frustrations,
anything on the mind. And again breath in that loving, joyful, blissful
energy. And again breath out anything not in line with your highter self.
Anything that's holding you back. Any fears, worries, again let that go.

Again breath in that loving joyful blissful energy. And one more time out
again, with anything that doesnt serve you let it out through just let
it out through that breath.

And what I want you to do now is keep breathing in that beautiful loving
joyful blissful energy, and breath that positive energy back out as you
start recycling that energy through the breath.

We're going to use this clearing method to clear out any negative energies and influences
and restore us back to our natural ballance energetically.

Just keep breathing that beautiful energy in and out through the breath.
And so I'm just going to welcome our guides and our higher self.
I ask that any chords, attachments, implants, parasitic thought forms,
anything that aren't in line with the wakening healing process of
humaninty in our fields and environment. We ask that it be escorted to
its perfect place or dissolve and go where it needs to. We also ask
for the healing energies to step forth, for any healing thats needed
on a physical or non-physical level. And we also ask for a blessing from
gaia, the origional spirits of the land, and the nature spirits and
elementals that are in line with the wakening healing process. And lastly,
we ask that we are sealed off in our own dome of protection, immune from
any outside influences, and we a ask that our main teacher and guide to
step forth to communicate if theres anything that we need to know at
this time through our thoughts, concepts and ideas.

Thank you.

-Peter Maxwell Slattery



Clearing technique to exercise imagination

Close your eyes, connect with the heart, and just think of love,
whatever loving thoughts you can think of, and imagine you're in
whatever color ball of light works for you thats a beautiful color
to you, imagine your whole body is engulfed in that.

Then in the heart area, imagine at the same time you are sending a
pulse of light up through the crown and down through the root
chakra, and almost igniting your flame and blasting everything almost
like your own solar flash.
