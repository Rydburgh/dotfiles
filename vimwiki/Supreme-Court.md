# Acts held unconstitutional by Supreme Court:
* 27. Act of Aug. 27, 1894 (28 Stat. 553–60, §§ 27–37).
	Income tax provisions of the tariff act of 1894. "The tax imposed by §§ 27 and 37, inclusive
	... so far as it falls on the income of real estate and of personal property, being a direct tax within the
	meaning of the Constitution, and, therefore, unconstitutional and void because not apportioned according
	to representation [Article I, § 2, clause 3], all those sections, constituting one entire scheme of taxation,
	are necessarily invalid" (158 U.S. 601, 637). {mersky2013}
* 45. Act of Sept. 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 757, § 2(a), in part).
	Provision of the income tax law of 1916, that a "stock dividend shall be considered income,
	to the amount of its cash value," held invalid (in spite of the Sixteenth Amendment) as an attempt to tax something
	not actually income, without regard to apportionment under Article I, § 2, clause 3. {mersky2013}
