# Cleaning up calendar.ics.
* looking for ways to do away with awk, awk is slow and complicated
* project on hold
# Learning markdown
* Ultisnips is working for markdown, so i'm going to practice using snippets and go through a YT tutorial
* make a wiki for syntax
* installing pandoc to convert from md to tex beamer
* updating mirrors:
	sudo pacman-mirrors --fasttrack 5 && sudo pacman -Syyu
	yay -S pandoc
* Looking for a way to do what the R Studio does with just vim, stumbled on
a blog post at geoidin.wordpress.com "executing commands from vim to R
in terminal similar to R-studio with two commands
```vim
	map <C-L> "kyy:echo system("screen -S $STY -p R -X stuff ".escape(shellescape(@k),"$"))<CR>j
	vmap <C-L> "xy:echo system("screen -S $STY -p R -X stuff ".escape(shellescape(@x."\n"),"$"))<CR>j
```
* Change map to <Leader>r
```vim
	map <C-L> "kyy:echo system("screen -S $STY -p R -X stuff ".escape(shellescape(@k),"$"))<CR>j
	vmap <C-L> "xy:echo system("screen -S $STY -p R -X stuff ".escape(shellescape(@x."\n"),"$"))<CR>j
```
> "Having these two lines in the .vimrc adds mapping to Ctrl-L in normal mode and in visual mode
to transfer commands from the current file to the window with R console opened under the current screen session."
